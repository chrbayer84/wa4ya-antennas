### About

Keyestudios Relay Shield KS0212 based antenna switch @WA4YA. Manual selection of 4 antennas possible using node red. One antenna is wired such that it becomes active when there is no power so logic is inverted for that antenna (the deltaloop antenna in this sketch). When an antenna is selected, all other antennas are disabled/disengaged.
